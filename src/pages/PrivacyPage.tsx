We do not purchase third-party data about you.",
  },
  {
    t: "2. How we use it",
    d: "Contact form submissions are used solely to respond to your inquiry and to improve how the group communicates. We do not use your details for unsolicited marketing. If we ever want to contact you about something else, we will ask first.",
  },
  {
    t: "3. Where it is stored",

    t: "4. External services and platforms",

When you navigate to external partner or client portals linked from this site, that portal's own privacy practices apply to your interaction with it. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies upon arrival.",

    t: "5. Cookies and analytics",

  {
    t: "7. Retention and deletion",
    d: "Inquiry records are retained as long as needed to respond and for basic record-keeping. You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of the information you have submitted by writing to the group through the contact page.",
  },
  {
    t: "8. Security",
